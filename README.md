Objective:
My objective is to gain hands-on experience in front-end development by building functional, responsive webpages. I believe that learning from real-world problems is the most effective way to learn.

Steps Performed:
In this project, I created a podcast page, which is a static webpage including a landing section. It features four podcasts: Puri Jagannadh, Tedx Talks, Sadhguru, and On Purpose. I have also included a few episodes from each of them.

Tools Used:
I developed the static webpage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Outcome:
The outcome of this project was gaining hands-on experience in building a static webpage. I learned how to manage paddings, margins, borders, and image visibility in various sections. Although the webpage does not include responsive components, it provided me with valuable industry-level experience.

Thank you, OASIS INFOBYTE, for giving me my first internship!
