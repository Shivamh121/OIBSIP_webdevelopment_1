 objective, steps performed, tools used, and the outcome in brief

 My Objective is to gain hands-on experience in front-end development by building functional, responsive webpages. I think, learing from real world problems is the real learning.

 Steps Perfomed: In this project, I made a podcast page which is an static web page including landing page and it includes 4 people's podcast namely: Puri jagannadh, Tedx talks, Sadhguru and On purpose. I also have included few episodes of all four of them.

 Tools used: I have made a Statuc Webpage using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

 Outcome: Outcome of this project is to get Hands on experience on how to make a Static Webpage, how to manage paddings, margins, borders, images visiblity of every section, etc. Though my webpage does not contain responsive components, but it gave me a good industry level experience.

 Thank You OASIS INFOBYTE for giving me my first internship
